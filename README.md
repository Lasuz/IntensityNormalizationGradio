Intensity Normalization is commonly used in deep learning to improve training performance. However, techniques that are used with natural images are often applied to medical data as well. That results not always in best outcome. In the following Medium post, I discuss common Intensity Normalization Techniques (MinMax, Z-Score, Percentile) and their impact on Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data.
